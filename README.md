# Hangouts Prototype
Mock UI of Google Hangouts in the style of Google Inbox app

An interesting demo of nested RecyclerViews.

Known issues (may be resolved in the future):
 - Search UI not made (currently has a placeholder toast)
 - Conversation UI not polished (just shows the same snippet with a transition to that layout + edit text box)
 - Compose transition not written (would be similar to the transition done in Inbox)
